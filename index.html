	    <h1>Exploring the current state and decline of the UK restaurant industry</h1>
	    <p class="lead">The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January and has continued to see a surge in the number of cases and deaths ever since. In the months that have passed since the 31st of January, the day the first case for COVID-19 was confirmed in the UK – many industries have been hit in negative ways, including the UK restaurant industry. The United Kingdom, that locked down on the 23rd of March following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s announcement, led to March 2020 signifying a nationwide decline for the industry.</p>
      <p class="lead">This project looks at the decline of seated diners in restaurants in the UK available on the OpenTable network. OpenTable, using a sample size of 20,000 restaurants, has included the year on year fall in seated diners for March 2020, when compared to March 2019. The dataset includes seated diners acquired through online reservations, phone reservations and walk-ins. The reduction in the number of seated diners over the year is further compared to lockdown dates to help compare the decisions made by diners. Furthermore, information on tourism in London from past years is available to understand how a halt in international tourism is contributing to the rate of decline.</p>
      <p class="lead">Comparing data from the period of a global pandemic, being March 2020, to the year before illustrates the impact COVID-19 has had on restaurants in the UK and around the world.</p>

      	  <h4>The decline of the UK restaurant industry</h4>
      	  <p>Like many industries, the restaurant sector has borne the brunt of the economic fallout of the UK lockdown. The interactive graph below illustrates the effects prior to and at the very beginning of the lockdown. Taking a closer look at the year on year change in seated diners, there was a gradual fall of around 25% from the 1 March until 14 March in comparison to 2019. In anticipation of the lockdown, between 14 and 17 March, the year on year fall accelerated to a drop in 60% of diners. By 21 March, this effect was compounded as seated diners in UK restaurants fell by 100% and the UK restaurant industry saw a state of complete decline.</p>

	  <h4>The decline of international restaurant industries</h4>
	  <p>Countries in the list of international industries include: Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, United Kingdom and United States.</p>
    <p>Similar to the graph above, international restaurant industries have reacted to their respective lockdowns in different ways and combining the daily averages from each country helps understand the international level of restaurants declining. The population, when looking closely at the year on year change, remained steady with dining on the OpenTable network until 8 March. As the implementation of more lockdowns are placed in order, seated diners saw a fall of 80% in the next 10 days of the month. By 24 March, seated diners on an international average fell by 100%, just one day after the United Kingdom, Mexico, Germany and Australia were placed under lockdown.</p>

	  <h4>Comparing the decline of restaurant industries in countries around the world based on lockdown implementations</h4>
	  <p>The GIF below helps analyse seated diners in countries around the world compared to the previous year by illustrating the speed of their respective industries’ decline. This visualisation takes a closer look at each country discussed above as part of the international restaurant industry on the OpenTable network. The number of seated diners per country have declined based on lockdowns implemented, which can be compared using the interactive map below the GIF.</p>
    <p>Mexico is the only country that's restaurant industry did not decline by 100% seated diners in the month of March. On the other hand, seated diners in Australia dropped by 60% the day the country was locked down, signifying the steepest rate of decline amongst countries listed. Furthermore, Germany and the United Kingdom saw their restaurant industries decline by 100% 2 days before both countries were locked down, with a similar rate of reduction in seated diners.</p>

    <h4>The average declining rates for each country's restaurant industry</h4>
    <p>Using the OpenTable network and a sample size of 20,000 restaurants in the UK and around the world help understand how March 2020 is nothing like March 2019 for the restaurant industry. To help conclude this project, the average reduction in seated diners in March on an international level helps summarise data from the visualisations above. The United Kingdom, with a percentage average of -44.20 shows that seated diners reduced steadily over the month of March and declined just before the country was placed under lockdown. Similarly, diners in Germany and Mexico followed similar paths and rates of decline, all of which locked down on 23 March. However, seated diners in Australia reacted much slower than the rest of the world, in spite of lockdown measures being taken the same day. Last of all, the country with the quickest decline in seated diners was Ireland, adding up to the decline of the UK and global restaurant industries.</p>
    <p>March 2020 signifying the beginning of the global outbreak analyses the reduction to zero seated diners across all countries measured, with the longer-term effect on the UK restaurant industry relying on the continued effects of COVID-19.</p>

<h5>International visitors in London: 2002 - 2018</h5>
<p>International visitors in London data, <a href="https://www.visitbritain.org/latest-quarterly-data-area">available here.</a></p>
<p>A factor that drives the restaurant industry is international tourism. In 2018, tourism accounted for 11% of UK GDP and every 54p per tourist pound was spent in London. With London accounting for over half of tourism revenues in 2018, I’ve taken a look at other longer-term trends in the UK’s most popular tourist destination. This data covers the total number of nights and amount spent in London per £m (2018 = £12.2 billion) between the years 2002 and 2018.</p>
<p>The growing popularity of the city from 2002 to 2007 is supported by the increase of 42% in tourism revenues where in the same time period, nights spent in the city increased by 34%. Both graphs show a fall in revenues and nights spent in the city from 2006-2009 which is a reflection of the previous global economic downturn. There was a bounce back seen between 2009 and 2013 where revenues increased by 40% and nights spent in the City increased by 26%. Both peaked in 2017 which followed by slight fall 2018 in nights spent and tourism revenue in London in 2018. Whilst there are many unknowns with regards to the long-term effect of Coronavirus on London’s tourism, the bounce back in nights spent in London and tourism revenues after 2009 could serve as some indication as to how tourism in London may recover.</p>
